## 👥 Team Notes

### Current Focus

Building the AI query interface to enable end-to-end document querying with the completed backend infrastructure.

### Blockers

None - all infrastructure and backend components are complete and tested.

### Risks

1. **OpenAI API costs**: Monitor usage during development
2. **Vector search performance**: May need index tuning with production data
3. **Frontend complexity**: Query streaming UI requires careful state management

### Opportunities

1. **Rapid prototyping**: Backend infrastructure enables quick feature iteration
2. **User testing**: Ready to start gathering feedback on query interface
3. **Performance baseline**: Good metrics to optimize against

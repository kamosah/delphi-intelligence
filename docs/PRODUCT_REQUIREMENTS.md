# Olympus MVP - Product Requirements Document

**Project Codename**: Athena
**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: MVP Development

---

## Executive Summary

Olympus is an **AI-powered document intelligence platform** inspired by Athena Intelligence. The platform enables enterprises to deploy AI analysts that function as "remote hires" - autonomous agents that can analyze documents, extract insights, automate research workflows, and provide real-time intelligence across multiple data sources.

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform documents into actionable intelligence by combining an always-on AI-native platform (Olympus) with autonomous AI agents (Athena) that integrate seamlessly into existing enterprise workflows.

Olympus MVP is directly inspired by [Athena Intelligence](https://www.athenaintel.com/), an enterprise AI platform that combines:

1. **Olympus Platform**: An AI-native infrastructure with integrated tools (spreadsheets, documents, notebooks, collaboration tools)
2. **Athena AI Agent**: An autonomous AI analyst that takes on roles like paralegal, intelligence analyst, market researcher, or financial analyst

### Our MVP Goal

Create a simplified version of Athena Intelligence focusing on:

- Document intelligence and analysis
- Query-based insights extraction
- Multi-source data integration
- Workspace collaboration
- Audit trails and transparency

   - Reasons over multiple sources
   - Generates response with inline citations
4. User sees response with clickable source citations
5. User can ask follow-up questions or refine query
6. All queries saved in history for later reference

### Flow 3: Team Collaboration

1. User shares Space with team member (via email invite)
2. Team member receives invite, joins Space with "Editor" role
3. Both users see shared query history
4. Team member adds a comment on a specific document
5. Original user receives notification of comment
6. Team discusses findings in comment thread

### Flow 4: Report Generation (Future)

1. User selects multiple queries and insights
2. User clicks "Generate Report"

### Technical Decisions

1. **Vector Database**: pgvector (simpler) vs Pinecone (more powerful)?
2. **LLM Provider**: OpenAI only or multi-provider from day 1?
3. **Real-time**: WebSockets custom implementation vs Supabase Realtime?
4. **File Storage**: Supabase Storage vs AWS S3?
5. **Deployment**: Vercel + Render, or all-in on AWS/GCP?

### UX/Design Decisions

1. **Chat Interface**: ChatGPT-style chat vs search-style interface?
2. **Document Viewer**: Inline PDF viewer or download-first approach?
3. **Mobile Support**: Mobile-responsive web app or native apps later?

# Olympus MVP - Product Requirements Document

**Project Codename**: Athena
**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: MVP Development

---

## Executive Summary

Olympus is a **hybrid intelligence platform** that bridges structured and unstructured data analysis. Inspired by both **Athena Intelligence** (document intelligence) and **Hex** (collaborative data analytics), Olympus enables teams to query across databases AND documents in a unified conversational interface—eliminating the need for separate BI tools and document analysis platforms.

**Core Value Proposition**: The first platform where data analysts can seamlessly combine live SQL queries with document intelligence—asking questions like "How does our Q4 revenue compare to competitor forecasts in these earnings reports?" and getting cited answers from both sources.

**UI/UX Philosophy**: 100% Hex-inspired aesthetic across all features, from database connections to document intelligence, providing a consistent, modern, professional data workspace.

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Product Decisions

1. **Pricing Model**: Free tier + paid plans, or enterprise-only?
2. **Target Market**: SMBs or enterprise focus first?
3. **Vertical Focus**: Start with one use case (legal, finance, research) or horizontal?
4. **Branding**: Keep "Olympus" or rebrand to distinguish from Athena Intelligence?

### Technical Decisions

1. **Vector Database**: pgvector (simpler) vs Pinecone (more powerful)?
2. **LLM Provider**: OpenAI only or multi-provider from day 1?
3. **Real-time**: WebSockets custom implementation vs Supabase Realtime?
4. **File Storage**: Supabase Storage vs AWS S3?
5. **Deployment**: Vercel + Render, or all-in on AWS/GCP?

### UX/Design Decisions

1. **Chat Interface**: ChatGPT-style chat vs search-style interface?
2. **Document Viewer**: Inline PDF viewer or download-first approach?
3. **Mobile Support**: Mobile-responsive web app or native apps later?

### Visual References

**IMPORTANT**: Olympus uses **100% Hex aesthetic** for all features, including document intelligence.

#### Hex Design System (PRIMARY)

See **[HEX_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](./HEX_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)** - Comprehensive design system documentation including:

- **Design Philosophy**: Data-first, conversational AI integration, professional tool aesthetic
- **Color Palette**: Extracted from Hex screenshots (TO_EXTRACT: exact hex values pending)
- **Typography**: System fonts, monospace for code, type scale
- **Layout Patterns**: Threads chat, SQL notebook cells, database connection UI
- **Component Library**: Buttons, inputs, cards, badges, code blocks
- **Interaction Patterns**: @mentions, cell execution, hover states, loading states

**Captured Hex Assets** (`docs/visual-references/hex/`):

- 8 full-page screenshots (13MB total)
- Homepage, Threads announcement, SQL cells, database connections, semantic layer
- Scripts ready for video download (manual YouTube video identification needed)

#### Athena Intelligence Visual References (FUNCTIONAL INSPIRATION ONLY)

See **[VISUAL_REFERENCES.md](./VISUAL_REFERENCES.md)** - Athena Intelligence feature catalog (215 assets):

## Overview

This document tracks important product, technical, and strategic decisions that need to be made before proceeding with full implementation. Each decision is marked with priority and impact level.

---

## 1. Branding & Positioning

### Decision 1.1: Product Name

**Priority**: üî¥ High
**Impact**: Brand identity, marketing, legal

**Question**: Should we keep the "Olympus" name or rebrand to distinguish from Athena Intelligence?

**Context**:

- Athena Intelligence uses "Olympus" as their platform name
- Using the same name could cause confusion or legal issues
- Your project is explicitly an MVP clone/recreation

**Options**:
| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Keep "Olympus"** | - Already in codebase<br>- Clearly inspired by Athena Intelligence<br>- No renaming work needed | - Potential trademark issues<br>- Could be seen as copycat<br>- Confusing for users | ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider if open-source/non-commercial |
| **Rename to something unique** | - No legal issues<br>- Build own brand<br>- Differentiation | - Renaming effort<br>- Lose Athena connection<br>- Marketing from scratch | ‚úÖ Recommended for commercial use |
| **Keep as tribute/OSS** | - Clear attribution<br>- Learning/portfolio project<br>- Open source community | - Must add clear disclaimers<br>- Not for commercial use | ‚úÖ Recommended for open-source |

**Your Decision**: [ ] Keep "Olympus" [ ] Rename to: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** [ ] Mark as OSS tribute

### Decision 1.2: Public Positioning

**Priority**: üî¥ High
**Impact**: Landing page, README, marketing materials

**Question**: Should the landing page explicitly say "Inspired by Athena Intelligence" or keep it subtle?

**Options**:
| Option | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Explicit Attribution** | "Inspired by Athena Intelligence" on landing page and README | Open-source projects, learning portfolios, tributes |
| **Subtle Reference** | Only mention in docs/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md | Commercial products, competitive alternatives |
| **No Mention** | Build as independent product with similar features | Fully independent commercial ventures |

**Your Decision**: [ ] Explicit [ ] Subtle [ ] No mention

**Notes**:

### Decision 1.3: Tagline/Value Proposition

**Priority**: üü° Medium
**Impact**: Landing page hero section, marketing copy

**Current Tagline**: "The AI-Native Operations Platform"

**Athena Intelligence Tagline**: "Athena, the first artificial data analyst"

**Recommended Options**:

1. **Direct Clone**: "Meet Athena, Your AI Analyst" (very similar to original)
2. **Modified Version**: "Your AI-Powered Document Analyst" (similar concept, different wording)
3. **Unique Angle**: "Transform Documents into Intelligence" (different positioning)

**Your Decision**: [ ] Option 1 [ ] Option 2 [ ] Option 3 [ ] Custom: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Decision 2.1: Vector Database Choice

**Priority**: üî¥ High (Critical for AI features)
**Impact**: Document search performance, cost, complexity

**Question**: Which vector database should we use for semantic search?

**Options**:
| Option | Pros | Cons | Cost | Complexity |
|--------|------|------|------|------------|
| **pgvector (PostgreSQL)** | - Already using PostgreSQL<br>- No additional service<br>- Simpler architecture<br>- Supabase supports it | - Less optimized for vectors<br>- Limited scale (< 1M vectors)<br>- Basic filtering | Free (included in DB) | Low |
| **Pinecone** | - Built for vector search<br>- Better performance<br>- Advanced filtering<br>- Scales to billions | - Additional service<br>- More complex setup<br>- Costs money | $70/mo (starter) | Medium |
| **Weaviate** | - Open source option<br>- Self-hosted or cloud<br>- Good performance | - Another service to manage<br>- Setup complexity | Free (self-host) or paid (cloud) | High |

**Recommendation**:

- **MVP**: pgvector (simpler, faster to implement)
- **Production**: Migrate to Pinecone if scale demands it

**Your Decision**: [ ] pgvector [ ] Pinecone [ ] Weaviate [ ] Decide later

## Recommendations from Product Manager

Based on my analysis of Athena Intelligence and your current codebase, here are my **recommended decisions** for a successful MVP:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Make These Decisions Now)

1. **Product Name**: Keep "Olympus" with clear disclaimer that you're inspired by Athena Intelligence
2. **Positioning**: Explicit attribution - be transparent it's a recreation/learning project
3. **Vector Database**: pgvector (simpler for MVP, can migrate later)
4. **LLM Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4 (best quality, fastest integration)
5. **License**: AGPL v3 if open source (protects your work), Proprietary if commercial

### Phase 2: Technical Decisions (Can Wait 2-3 Weeks)

6. **First Feature**: Document Upload & Storage ‚Üí Document Processing ‚Üí AI Query
7. **Real-Time**: Supabase Realtime for MVP (easier)
8. **Target User**: Research Analysts (clearest use case, matches Athena Intelligence)

### Phase 3: Business Decisions (Post-MVP)

9. **Monetization**: Start as open source, consider freemium after validation
10. **Deployment**: Vercel + Render (easiest for MVP)

## How Assets Were Captured

Due to CDN authentication requirements on Athena Intelligence's image hosting (mintcdn.com), direct downloads are not possible. All assets were captured using automated tools:

1. **Playwright Browser Automation** - Renders documentation pages in headless browser to capture screenshots
2. **YouTube Video Download** - Downloads demo videos using yt-dlp
3. **FFmpeg Frame Extraction** - Extracts key frames from videos at regular intervals

**For complete automation instructions**, see [AUTOMATED_VISUAL_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md](./AUTOMATED_VISUAL_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md)

- Videos converted from MPEG-TS to MP4 format for compatibility
- Frame extraction rate: 0.5 FPS for main demo, 0.33 FPS for settings, 0.2 FPS for interview
- CDN authentication signatures prevent direct image downloads from mintcdn.com
- Playwright automation successfully bypasses signature requirement by rendering pages
